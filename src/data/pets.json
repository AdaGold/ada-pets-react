      "about": "This is Ethan. He is a 12 week old Husky/spaniel mix. Right now he weighs about 14 pounds but will be a large dog when grown. Ethan is a love of a boy. He’s quiet and gentle. He is definitely the most easy going of his 8 siblings. His demeanor is playful yet not rambunctious like most puppies. This little charmer will win you over. He does have a partial blue eye which makes him look a little odd but I think it’s gorgeous.

      "about": "“Baby Ruth! Baby Ruth!” Our older girl Ruth here may be a little older but don’t count her out! Ruth is a timid older lady that would love a new home for the rest of her days. Ruth loves attention but is slow to warming up just to make sure that you are here to stay. Her favorite spot in a home would be either on your lap or laying is the sun that shines through the windows. Ruth would like a calmer home due to being older and timid. She would make a great companion for someone who enjoys having a calmer cat that will do her own thing but gives you plenty of attention! If your home sounds like the perfect match for Ruth, come and meet her today!",

Although my foster family loves me very much, they want me to find the best home possible. I have all of my shots up to date and I am already spayed. I’m still a puppy but I’m working really hard on being potty trained. I am sweet to everyone I meet and very playful. I get along with other dogs and children very well. I love hugs and kisses and hope to find a new home soon.",

I'm super sad now as my brother got adopted this past weekend (even though I'm super happy for him) and I have no one to play with.
